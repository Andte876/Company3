\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks that may arise during the execution of our software engineering project with Axis Communications. The risk management ensures that the project progresses smoothly, remains on schedule, and stays within the allocated budget. By proactively addressing potential challenges, we aim to minimize disruptions and maximize the likelihood of project success.

This document outlines the framework for identifying, categorizing, and responding to risks associated with the project, including technical, financial, operational, and resource-related risks. As students working on this project, we recognize that uncertainties may emerge from several factors such as limited technical expertise, resource constraints, and external dependencies.

The Risk Management Plan provides a structured approach to handling these uncertainties by detailing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk Identification}: A systematic process to identify and document potential risks that could impact the project.
    \item \textbf{Risk Description}: An explanation of each identified risk to give more context.
    \item \textbf{Risk Analysis}: A quantitative evaluation of identified risks to understand their likelihood and impact.
    \item \textbf{Risk Planning}: Actions and contingency plans to reduce the impact or likelihood of high-priority risks.
    \item \textbf{Risk Monitoring}: Ongoing evaluation of risks throughout the project lifecycle to adapt to new challenges.
\end{itemize}

By following this Risk Management Plan, our team is committed to staying proactive and adaptable in handling risks that may affect our progress.

\section{Risk Identification}

Through the Risk Breakdown Structure below, potential risks that may impact the project are identified, categorized, and described for further analysis and mitigation.

\section{Risk Description}
The following table provides detailed descriptions of each identified risk, outlining their potential causes and specific impacts on the project to support further analysis and mitigation efforts.

\section{Risk Analysis}

To evaluate risks, each will be graded on a scale from 1 to 4 for both probability and impact, with 1 representing the lowest and 4 the highest levels. The risk magnitude is then calculated by multiplying the probability by the impact, yielding a risk magnitude indicator ranging from 1 to 16.
