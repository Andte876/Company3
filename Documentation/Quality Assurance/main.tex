\section{Introduction}
This Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Plan is a crucial document for our TDDC88 project, aiming to ensure the highest quality standards in our software development process. As we are targeting grade 5, this plan incorporates all necessary components to meet and exceed the course requirements.

The purpose of this document is twofold:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To provide a comprehensive framework for maintaining and improving software quality throughout our development lifecycle.
    \item To clearly communicate responsibilities and expectations to all team members, ensuring a coordinated effort towards achieving our quality goals.
\end{enumerate}

This plan is designed to be a living document, regularly updated to reflect our evolving practices and lessons learned. Each section outlines specific quality assurance activities, their purpose, and the individuals responsible for their implementation.


\section{Document Structure and Ownership}
\textit{Responsible: *Adrian* TechnicalWriter}

This section details the overall structure of the SQA plan, ensuring it is well-organized, easily navigable, and accessible to all team members. The structure is designed to support continuous improvement and integration with our overall development processes.

\subsection{Document Structure}
The SQA plan is organized into clearly defined sections, each corresponding to a key aspect of our quality assurance process. This structure ensures:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Easy navigation and quick reference for team members
    \item Clear delineation of responsibilities
    \item Logical flow from high-level strategy to specific implementation details
    \item Facilitation of regular updates and continuous improvement
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Authorship}
Each section owner is responsible for authorship of their own section. This decentralized approach ensures that the content is created and maintained by those with the most relevant expertise. Responsibility for formatting and information sharing about the Quality Assurance plan is shared between Emma and Adrian:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Emma - Strategic Product Owner}: Responsible for stakeholder communication and ensuring alignment with project goals
    \item \textit{Adrian Technical Writer}: Responsible for version control, document formatting, and maintaining overall document consistency
\end{itemize}

This collaborative approach supports continuous improvement by leveraging diverse expertise and maintaining clear lines of communication.

\subsection{Version Control System}
To support requirements for integration with development processes and continuous improvement, we implement a robust version control system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The document is primarily edited in Overleaf, a collaborative LaTeX editor, shared with all responsible authors
    \item Weekly updates are made to GitLab every Thursday at 8am, before the weekly company meeting
    \item Each GitLab update includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The latest version of the document
        \item A brief note detailing changes made since the last update
        \item Any relevant discussion points or decisions made regarding the document
    \end{itemize}
    \item Special updates are made before tollgate meetings, taking precedence over the regular weekly schedule
    \item GitLab's version history feature is used to track changes over time, supporting our continuous improvement efforts
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Continuous Improvement and Integration}
This structure supports continuous improvement and integration with overall development processes by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Enabling real-time collaboration through Overleaf
    \item Providing a clear schedule for updates, aligning with project milestones and meetings
    \item Utilizing GitLab's features to track changes and facilitate discussions
    \item Ensuring the SQA plan evolves alongside the project, reflecting current best practices and lessons learned
    \item Facilitating easy access and reference for all team members, promoting a culture of quality throughout the development process
\end{itemize}

It is our belief that by maintaining this structured approach to document management and version control, we ensure that our SQA plan remains a living, evolving guide that directly supports our commitment to high-quality software development and continuous process improvement.
