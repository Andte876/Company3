\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this Customer Requirements Specification is to define the customer’s needs and expectations for the development of the system. It serves as a basis for communication between the customer Axis Communications and Company 3, ensuring that all parties have a common understanding of the project’s objectives and scope. The document will guide the system's design, implementation and testing in accordance with the IEEE standard 830-1998.


\subsection{Scope}

The scope of the project is to create a functional system integrating Axis communications surveillance cameras and speakers with an easy to use user interface which shall be tailed for a security company. The system will support multiple user classes including guard, operator, manager and admin which will all have different access levels and functionalities. 

The systems core functions include Axis surveillance cameras with functions such as object recognition, alert functions and the possibility to view live camera feeds.  The system shall alert the operator when a person enters the view of the camera and the operator can then approve or discard the alarm. Other functions which will be focused on enabling is the possibility for the admin to schedule when the cameras shall be active and also for the manager to be able retrieve different kinds of statistics which can be used for staff planning. 

The project is conducted by 27 students from Linköping University taking the course TDDC88 - Software Engineering working in collaboration with Axis Communications. The project group, from here on called Company 3, consists of students with diverse educational backgrounds, including industrial engineering, computer science, and information systems analysis. Each company member has a time constraint of 160 hours to be spent on this project. 

The scope does not include hardware installation and network setup. 

\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviation}

This section provides an overview of the user classes within the system and their overall purpose. It also includes a list of abbreviations relevant to understanding the requirements in this document.

\subsubsection{User classes}
This subsection describes the user classes in the system. Classes are linked to an accounts access level of which an specific account is limited to just one. The exception to this is that the admin class described below is a "master class" meaning that it has access to all specific functionality of the operator and manager classes of which there is no other overlap. This can be visualized in figure 1 below.

\begin{figure} [H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{TDDC88 - User Hierarchy.png}
    \caption{Visualization of user class hierarchy.}
    \label{fig:your_label}
\end{figure}

In practice the user classes and their functionality are as follows: 

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Guard:} the guard account only exists as a means to store data on the respective guard including username, name and email. The guard is then notified via the stored email address where they can view details of the alarm including a snapshot when an alarm is raised. The guards have no actual access to the web application.
    
    \item \textbf{Operator:} the operator account has access to the class specific alarm dashboard-page. Here the user can survey the system and most importantly receive notifications of when the system detects a potential intruder. After which they are able to either approve or dismiss alarms based on the snapshot provided by the camera and information such as camera ID, location e.t.c. They are also able to cancel active alarms through the dashboard.
    
    \item \textbf{Manager:} the account has access to the class specific statistics-page of the application where they can review the data of triggered alarms such as false- and true positives, dates and times e.t.c in order to take informed decisions on e.g. staff planning and camera locations. The lack access to the alarm dashboard-page of the operators.
    
    \item \textbf{Admin:} the account has access to both of the above operator and manager specific pages as well as an admin exclusive page where confidence level of the camera and scheduling of when the alarm system shall be active can be adjusted. Furthermore the admin has the ability to create accounts and adjust classes of existing accounts. As explained above, a master class of the application excluding the guard which is to be regarded as part of the system but not the application.
    
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Abbreviations}

\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{ACAP:} Axis Camera Application Platform, "An open application platform for software-based solutions built around Axis devices." \cite{ACAP}
     \item \textbf{GDPR:} General Data Protection Regulation,
"This regulation sets out provisions regarding the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data." \cite{GDPR}

\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{Product Perspective}

\subsubsection{User Stories}

The following section outlines the desired functionality of the system based on various user classes and their interactions. These user stories describe the specific actions and expectations for Operators, Administrators, and Guards in managing the system effectively. Each story reflects the system's intended behavior in real-time surveillance and alarm management scenarios, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.

Each user story is linked to functional and non-functional requirements based on their respective IDs.

 \begin{itemize}
 
    \item As an \textbf{Operator}, I want the system to recognize and classify objects and notify me when this is done to a 95\% confidence level, raising an alarm within 5 seconds by a clear user-friendly alert on the application dashboard. (Requirements: \hyperlink{FRQ001}{FRQ001-v1}, \hyperlink{FRQ003}{FRQ003-v1}, \hyperlink{FRQ013}{FRQ013-v1}, \hyperlink{NRQ005}{NRQ005-v1})
    
    \item When an alert of a detection is sent, the \textbf{Operator}, shall clearly be able to make an informed decision about if the alert should be dismissed or the alarm should be raised by displaying information about the location of the camera, the object identified, and a snapshot of the intruder.

(Requirements: \hyperlink{FRQ002}{FRQ002-v1}, \hyperlink{FRQ015}{FRQ015-v1}, \hyperlink{NRQ002}{NRQ002-v1})

    \item As an \textbf{Admin}, I want to update the camera schedule and confidence level within 10 minutes of request, so I can manage operations efficiently and fine-tune object recognition. (Requirements: \hyperlink{FRQ006}{FRQ006-v1}, \hyperlink{FRQ007}{FRQ007-v1}, \hyperlink{NRQ003}{NRQ003-v1}, \hyperlink{NRQ004}{NRQ004-v1})

    \item As an \textbf{Admin}, I want the system to support multiple user categories (Operator, Manager, Admin), and I want to be able to configure the system so I can manage access levels for specific accounts and control system operations. (Requirements: \hyperlink{FRQ014}{FRQ014-v1}, \hyperlink{FRQ018}{FRQ018-v1}, \hyperlink{NRQ007}{NRQ007-v1})

    \item As a \textbf{Manager}, I want to see the number of alerts, the time of these alerts, location of these alerts, and if they were accurate and decided to require an alarm. I want to see this in a visual view, displaying these statistics as diagrams, for a clear overview. (Requirements: \hyperlink{FRQ010}{FRQ010-v1}, \hyperlink{FRQ011}{FRQ011-v1}, \hyperlink{FRQ012}{FRQ012-v1}, \hyperlink{FRQ017}{FRQ017-v1}, \hyperlink{NRQ005}{NRQ005-v1}, \hyperlink{NRQ006}{NRQ006-v1})

\end{table}

\subsection{Product Functions}
The system will use the Axis camera and speaker to identify potential intruders. The software that will be developed will enable users to access different functionality such as alerts, camera settings and visual dashboards of the history. The concrete functions of the system will be: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Object Recognition:} The system shall recognize and classify objects in motion with a confidence level presented as a percentage. This feature uses advanced image processing algorithms built into the cameras to identify objects and determine their types.
    \item \textbf{Alerts to Operator:} Upon detecting a potential threat, the camera system will generate an alert that will be sent to the active operator. This alert includes sending images/videos, location and timestamp to the operational system and triggering an alarm if the threat is confirmed.
    \item \textbf{Alerts to Database:} Upon creating an alert, the timestamp, image/video, location and camera ID will be sent to the database.
    \item \textbf{Alarm Management:} Operators will have the ability to manage alarms by turning on or off the alarm system, including the speaker, and will have the option to confirm or deny the alarm based on the assessment of the displayed threat.
    \item \textbf{Scheduling Management:} Admin users will be able to configure and update the camera schedule. This function allows for flexible scheduling to ensure optimal camera coverage.
    \item \textbf{Confidence Adjustment:} Admin users will be able to adjust the camera’s confidence level. This allows for fine-tuning of the object recognition system to improve accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Live Camera Feeds:} Operators will have access to live feeds from active cameras, including their locations, to monitor real-time activities.
    \item \textbf{User Interface Navigation:} The system will provide an intuitive interface for operators to navigate through active camera feeds and manage alert responses effectively.
    \item \textbf{Alert Visualization:} Managers will have access to visual representations of alerts as data points, including the number of alerts, their locations, and timestamps. This data will be displayed in diagrams for easy analysis.
    \item \textbf{Alert Notifications Operator:} The system will visually indicate when an alert occurs through pop-ups or window changes, ensuring that operators are promptly informed.
    \item \textbf{User Management:} The system will support multiple user categories (Guard, Operator, Manager, Admin) with different access levels and capabilities. This includes the ability to manage user permissions and classes.
    \item \textbf{Integration and Accessibility:} The system will include standard pages such as login, user profile management, and system configuration to ensure ease of use and accessibility for authorized users.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General Constraints}
Since Company 3 consists of 27 employees from with varying competences, it requires effective coordination and task allocation to leverage the specialized knowledge of each discipline. Furthermore, one can assume that a significant amount of the time budget must be used on educating employees on areas of lacking expertise. 

The aforementioned time budget, presenting the largest constraint of the project, is a strict limit of 160 hours per employee. This necessitates efficient time management, prioritization of tasks, and the implementation of streamlined processes to ensure that the project is completed within the available time frame. 

The nature of the company operating within the boundaries of a university course create other certain time constraints that the company must adhear to. This includes strict deadlines of iterations, pre-planned meetings, assignments e.tc. which limit the possibility of true to life operations and consumes a portion of the total time budget. 

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
The following assumptions have been made of the system, its users and customers:

\subsubsection{Installation of Cameras and Networking}
Company 3 delimits itself from responsibility in any part of either the installation of the cameras nor the networking that would be needed for application for an end-customer. The construction of the system will take little to no regard to ease of first installation, instead focusing on the usability of a pre-installed system.

\subsubsection{Staff Planning}
One of the systems key functionality will be to provide the manager statistics to create cost effective staff planning of the security system. This functionality will be based on historic data from the used camera, and will be displayed in a functional diagram to create a visual tool for the user to interpret.

\subsubsection{Dashboard Monitoring}
Company 3 assumes that the dashboard of the system will be monitored constantly by the end customers staff to take informed decisions on the alarms. This means that we will not send automatic notifications to guards in case of a lack of action on triggered alarms.

\subsection{Lower Ambition Levels}
To manage risks related to the time budget or other resource constraints, certain features or goals of this project may be considered for reduction or deferral. The before mentioned user stories represent the functionality that will be implemented, with a focus on usability, as per the customer's wishes. Beyond these user stories, some additional functional experiences may be added, depending on the available time, to further improve the delivered product. The following areas are identified as candidates for scope reduction without risking the delivered products functionality:

\subsubsection{Non-essential Features}
The user stories previously mentioned are describing the systems core functionality, in terms of viable time other good to have functionalities that could enhance the user experience or provide additional capabilities might be added. These are however not critical to the system's primary operations thereby not prioritised.

\subsubsection{Performance Optimization}
Enhancing the performance of a system should always be a goal of development, however minimum acceptable standards could be adjusted to meet budget constraints. As a base for the iteration the development team has set a standard success rate on 95 percent, but this will be further investigated through out the projects development. The code will however be designed to allow for addressing this in future iterations of the system. 

\subsubsection{Non-critical Testing}
Non-critical testing scenarios, such as edge cases or performance stress testing beyond expected operational loads, may be reduced to focus on core functional and usability testing. The main testing will be designed to confirm or deny the user stories previously mentioned. The main tests are further described in the testplan.

\section{Specific Requirements}

\subsection{Interface Requirements}
The system shall provide an interface which makes it easy to use and access. In order to achieve this the system shall have a cohesive graphic design when it comes to font, font size, header size, color scheme, page structure etc. The system shall have an interface which is intuitive to use such as standard pages in the application, i.e. login page, change information, start page and so on. Additionally, the user shall also be able to orient into active camera feeds and to dashboards presenting statistics. 


\subsection{Functional Requirements}
The system provides different functionality depending on the access level of the current user. User types follow a hierarchical structure, where each successive level grants increased access compared to the one before. The master class of admin, will have full access to the system. This will allow admins to set up new accounts, add cameras, adjust scheduling and adjust access. 

The camera will detect objects in motion, and based on the current confidence level and selected threat types, an alert will be sent to the operator. The camera will also record  timestamp, location, and capture a snapshot or video, which will be stored in a database. The operator will assess the alert and determine the appropriate course of action. If the alert is confirmed as a genuine threat, it will be marked as "verified" which triggers an alarm. For verified threats, the operator will notify a guard providing them with the timestamp, location, and key imagery from the incident. 

The system will include a page dedicated to displaying statistics, accessible by the supervisor. This page will retrieve data from the database and display the number of alerts, their locations, and timestamps in a diagram.

\subsection{Design Constraints}


No significant design elements were requested by Axis Communications, which gives a degree of freedom to be more creative with the design approach. This flexibility allows room to explore various possibilities in terms of functionality and aesthetics, without being constrained by predefined requirements. However, while there is room to innovate, it is crucial that the system remains intuitive and user-friendly. The design shall be developed in iterations through close cooperation between developers, analysts and Axis Communications.


\subsection{Software System Attributes}

\textbf{THIS TEXT MIGHT BE MOVED TO ARCHITECTURAL NOTEBOOK}

\subsubsection{Kubernetes}
The system must be scalable to accommodate varying workloads by utilizing Kubernetes for container orchestration. Kubernetes will be responsible for automating the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers. This will allow the system to efficiently manage spikes in user activity, ensuring that the application can support an expected maximum of [X] concurrent users without performance degradation. The specific requirements referring to the use of Kubernetes are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
The system should automatically scale based on resource demand (CPU, memory).
    \item 
High availability through Kubernetes clusters with redundant nodes.
    \item 
The system should maintain availability even under peak user loads or infrastructure failures.
    \item 
Monitoring and self-healing capabilities must be enabled via Kubernetes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Code Standards}
The system must adhere to well-defined coding standards to ensure maintainability, scalability, and consistency across the development lifecycle. The code should follow code standards introduced at Linköping University, ensuring that it is clean, readable, and easy to extend. Compliance with these standards will also enhance collaboration across teams and minimize technical debt. The specific requirements referring to the code standards are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
Developers must adhere to established code guidelines. All code should follow consistent naming conventions, indentation, and commenting practices.
    \item 
The project must utilize Gitlab as a version control system, adhering to the GitFlow branching strategy to ensure organized collaboration and version management.
    \item 
Unit tests, integration tests, and code coverage thresholds (e.g., 80 percentage) must be implemented to verify the correctness of the system and prevent regressions during updates.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Language Limitation}
The system must be developed using specific programming languages and technologies due to project requirements and platform constraints, C is required for ACAP development. The choice of languages is required to ensure compatibility with target platforms and shall allow a smooth user experience. The specific requirements referring to the language limitation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
All components interacting directly with Axis devices must be written in C, as this is the supported language for ACAP development.
    \item 
Depending on future system requirements, frameworks such as React or Angular may be considered for front-end development to improve development efficiency and ensure scalability.
\end{itemize}
